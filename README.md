This repo contains a very simple hash table implementation in C++.

It also contains some hash join implementations.

A. Introduction

The hash table is populated using data generated by the TPC-H dbgen tool.

Tested using SF-1.

Preliminar C++ implementation.

B. Compilation

The repo includes the hash table implementation and the data generator, along some
utilities for columnizing the read relations (indicated in the main app).

Such utilities where taken and customized from the Vitis Database library 2021.2 version.

The code has been tested using standard GNU tools, thus compilation
should be as simple as:

    $make all

C. Usage

    $./main -work . -sf 1

where the scale factor argument can be changed to 1, 10 or 100.

D. Hash Join tests

The first test implements a canonical Hash Join and executes the following query:

```
select
        sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
from
        orders,
        lineitem
where
        l_orderkey = o_orderkey
        and o_orderdate >= date '1994-01-01'
        and o_orderdate < date '1996-01-01'
;
```

printing the total revenue within years 1994 and 1995.
